# Spade Compiler Development TODOs

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Lexer implementation with token recognition
- [x] Parser with AST generation for variable declarations  
- [x] Symbol table for variable tracking
- [x] Semantic analysis with type checking
- [x] Error detection for type mismatches, undeclared variables, redeclarations
- [x] Test cases for semantic error validation
- [x] Stack-based IR generation system
- [x] IR instruction set design (PUSH_CONST, PUSH_VAR, ADD, etc.)
- [x] IR code generation with post-order AST traversal
- [x] Integration of IR generation into compiler pipeline
- [x] Comprehensive documentation for all functions

## üîÑ Next: Virtual Machine Implementation

### Phase 1: Virtual Machine Core
- [ ] Create VM data structures (stack, variables, program counter)
- [ ] Implement stack operations (push, pop with overflow/underflow checks)
- [ ] Implement variable storage and retrieval
- [ ] Create instruction dispatcher/interpreter loop

### Phase 2: Instruction Execution
- [ ] Implement arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD, POW)
- [ ] Implement comparison operations (EQ, NE, LT, GT, LE, GE)
- [ ] Implement logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- [ ] Implement unary operations (NEG, NOT)
- [ ] Add execution tracing and debugging output

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test VM with all existing IR test cases
- [ ] Verify correct expression evaluation results
- [ ] Add VM execution to main compiler pipeline
- [ ] Create end-to-end execution tests

## üöÄ Future Language Features
- [ ] Function declarations and calls (CALL, RET instructions)
- [ ] Variable scoping (stack frames, local variables)
- [ ] Control flow statements (if/else, loops with JUMP instructions)
- [ ] Arrays and data structures
- [ ] Standard library functions (print, input)
- [ ] Error handling and exceptions

## üìù Current Architecture
**Complete Interpreter Pipeline**:
1. **Lexer** ‚Üí Tokens
2. **Parser** ‚Üí AST  
3. **Semantic Analysis** ‚Üí Type checking & validation
4. **IR Generation** ‚Üí Stack-based bytecode ‚úÖ
5. **Virtual Machine** ‚Üí Execution ‚è≥

**IR Instruction Set**: Stack-based with operations for constants, variables, arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
